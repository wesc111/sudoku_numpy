Introduction
==============

**Sudoku** is a logic based, *combinational* number-placement puzzle.
The objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column, 
each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 subgrids (that are called "blocks") 
contains all of the digits from 1 to 9. 
The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, 
which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution.

The following shows an example SUDOKU and it's solution.
